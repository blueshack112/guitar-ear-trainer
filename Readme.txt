GUITAR EAR TRAINER
++By, Hassan Ahmed++
================================

Introduction:
	This will be my first project on github, lets see how it goes. The project is one of my Final Lab projects. First, I will test usage of audio files and try to create a virtual guitar using a 2D array of Sound Objects.

Expected working:
	Music can be easily identified by ear when using intervals, instead of trying to determine each string of each note. An interval is a combination of two notes, each type of interval has pre-defined shape which create that specific type of interval anywhere on the fretboard. Working out the relationship between two notes and then guessing the music progression is deemed as a much easier and faster method of understanding music.
	Even after being easy and faster, training one's ear to interpret intervals requires a lot of practice, this is where this software should help. The software will be loaded with the sound of each string's each fret separately. A 2D array will construct a virtual guitar, using variable to play different shapes of music intervals can create a question, one which will be answered by the user. Feedback will be given by the software.

More updates and added features will have this readme document updated.

5-14-2017: Finally found the best way of storing the whole 2D array of wav files into bytes. They can be easily written to temporary file now, and played.
	Will not focus largely on the GUI of the application, Netbeans can give a good enough GUI.
