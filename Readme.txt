GUITAR EAR TRAINER
++By, Hassan Ahmed++
================================

Introduction:
	This will be my first project on github, lets see how it goes. The project is one of my Final Lab projects. First, I will test usage of audio files and try to create a virtual guitar using a 2D array of Sound Objects.

Expected working:
	Music can be easily identified by ear when using intervals, instead of trying to determine each string of each note. An interval is a combination of two notes, each type of interval has pre-defined shape which create that specific type of interval anywhere on the fretboard. Working out the relationship between two notes and then guessing the music progression is deemed as a much easier and faster method of understanding music.
	Even after being easy and faster, training one's ear to interpret intervals requires a lot of practice, this is where this software should help. The software will be loaded with the sound of each string's each fret separately. A 2D array will construct a virtual guitar, using variable to play different shapes of music intervals can create a question, one which will be answered by the user. Feedback will be given by the software.

More updates and added features will have this readme document updated.
